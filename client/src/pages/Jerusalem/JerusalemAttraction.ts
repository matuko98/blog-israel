Located in the Old City of Jerusalem as seen on our Jerusalem map, it is the last remaining outer wall of the ancient Jewish temple and an incredibly important site of modern Israeli history. Thousands of people of all faiths journey to the wall every year to visit and recite prayers. Traditionally, these prayers are either spoken or written down and placed in the cracks of the wall. The wall splits into two sections, one area for males and the other for females.",
